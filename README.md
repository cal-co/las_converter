## Python projects for well log analysis

### What is LAS file
**LAS** file contains physical properties data of vertical subsurface
used in well log analysis. Well log data saved in LAS file contains
some information, including its file **version**, **well description**,
**physical rock curve** along with data table and other information related
to the well data.

### Project feature(s)
- Load LAS data from various sources:
    - URL link (`https://example.com/.../.../path/to/lasfile.LAS`)
    - Local file (`path/to/lasfile.LAS` instead without `https`)
- Getting well log description.
- Save well log data into JSON file.
